# My Scheduler App
A full-stack scheduling application that helps users efficiently plan their time by automatically organizing tasks based on priorities, deadlines, and available time slots.

## About

This project is a web-based evolution of the scheduling algorithm originally created by Andrew Roe in [quick-sched](https://github.com/AndrewRoe34/quick-sched). While the original project was a Java CLI application, this implementation will provide a full web interface and additional features using modern development practices.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Entity Framework Core
- Domain driven design, CQRS pattern, Clean (Onion) Architecture

### Frontend
- Angular

## Features

- Automatic task scheduling based on:
  - Task priority
  - Deadlines
  - Duration
  - Available time slots
- Smart conflict resolution
- [More soon]

## Project Status

ðŸš§ This project is currently under development. 

## Project Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
- .NET Core SDK 8.11
- Node.js â‰¥18.19.1 (recommended: 22.0.0)
- Angular CLI 19.x (npm install -g @angular/cli@19)
- SQL Server (one of the following):
  - Local installation
  - Docker container
  - Azure SQL Database

### Backend Setup

#### 1. Database Configuration
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend/src/Api
   ```

2. Create environment configuration:
   - Copy `Sample.env` to create a new `.env` file
   - Update the database connection string in `.env` according to your SQL Server setup

#### 2. Starting the Backend
1. Ensure your SQL Server instance is running and accessible

2. From the `src/Api` directory, start the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   Note: Database migrations will be applied automatically on startup

3. Verify the backend is running:
   - Open http://localhost:5169/swagger/index.html in your browser
   - You should see the Swagger UI documentation

### Frontend Setup

#### 1. Installing Dependencies
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### 2. Starting the Frontend
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

2. Access the application:
   - Open http://localhost:4200 in your browser
   - You should see the frontend application running


## Project Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts, organized into bounded contexts. The architecture is structured into several distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility:

### Layers

#### API Layer
- Entry point for all external requests
- Handles HTTP requests/responses
- Manages routing and basic request validation
- Separated by feature contexts (Calendar, Scheduling)

#### Application Layer
- Orchestrates flow between API and Domain layers
- Contains application-specific business rules
- Implements use cases and application services
- Manages DTOs and interface contracts

#### Domain Layer
- Heart of the business logic
- Contains domain entities, value objects, and domain events
- Implements core business rules and domain logic
- Completely independent of other layers

#### Infrastructure Layer
- Implements persistence and external service integration
- Contains concrete implementations of repository interfaces
- Manages database context and migrations
- Handles technical concerns (logging, caching, etc.)

### Bounded Contexts

The application is divided into two main bounded contexts:

#### Calendar Context
- Manages calendar-related operations
- Handles working days, time slots, and calendar items
- Manages calendar-specific business rules

#### Scheduling Context
- Handles task scheduling and management
- Implements scheduling algorithms and priority handling
- Manages task-related operations and states

Each context maintains its own set of models, services, and repositories across all layers, ensuring proper separation of concerns and maintainability.
