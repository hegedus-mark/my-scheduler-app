# Smart Scheduler

A full-stack scheduling application that helps users efficiently plan their time by automatically organizing tasks based on priorities, deadlines, and available time slots.

## About

This project is a web-based evolution of the scheduling algorithm originally created by Andrew Roe in [quick-sched](https://github.com/AndrewRoe34/quick-sched). While the original project was a Java CLI application, this implementation will provide a full web interface and additional features using modern development practices.
